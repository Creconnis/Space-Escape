# Space-Escape
Space Escape is a basic video game realized in Java. Born for fun, it was used as a project and demonstration of our basic programming skills in the final exam of our course of study. It includes all the fundamentals of object-oriented and client/server programming, and the basic functions of classic third-person role-playing video games.
